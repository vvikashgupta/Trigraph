"""
In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, the root an, followed by other, which can form another word another.

Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.

You need to output the sentence after the replacement.

 

Example 1:

Input: dict = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
 

Constraints:

The input will only have lower-case letters.
1 <= dict.length <= 1000
1 <= dict[i].length <= 100
1 <= sentence words number <= 1000
1 <= sentence words length <= 1000
